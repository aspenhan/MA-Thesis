  abstract = {In randomized controlled trials, treatment is often assigned by stratified randomization. I show that among all stratified randomization schemes that treat all units with probability one half, a certain matched-pair design achieves the maximum statistical precision for estimating the average treatment effect. In an important special case, the optimal design pairs units according to the baseline outcome. In a simulation study based on datasets from ten randomized controlled trials, this design lowers the standard error for the estimator of the average treatment effect by 10 percent on average, and by up to 34 percent, relative to the original designs.

  abstract = {Summary             This paper provides a framework for testing multiple null hypotheses simultaneously using experimental data in which simple random sampling is used to assign treatment status to units. Using general results from the multiple testing literature, we develop under weak assumptions a procedure that (i) asymptotically controls the familywise error rate—the probability of one or more false rejections—and (ii) is asymptotically balanced in that the marginal probability of rejecting any true null hypothesis is approximately equal in large samples. Our procedure improves upon classical methods by incorporating information about the joint dependence structure of the test statistics when determining which null hypotheses to reject, leading to gains in power. An important point of departure from prior work is that we exploit observed, baseline covariates to obtain further gains in power. The precise way in which we incorporate these covariates is based on recent results from the statistics literature in order to ensure that inferences are typically more powerful in large samples.},

  abstract = {Existing tests of reference-dependent preferences assume universal loss aversion. This paper examines the implications of heterogeneity in gain-loss attitudes for such tests. In experiments on labor supply and exchange behavior we measure gain-loss attitudes and then study a canonical treatment effect that distinguishes different models of reference dependence. We document substantial heterogeneity in gain-loss attitudes and evidence against universal loss aversion. We then document heterogeneous treatment effects over gain-loss attitudes consistent with formulations of expectationsbased reference points. Assuming homogeneous preferences would lead to different and possibly incorrect conclusions in these tests. Our findings provide foundational support for reference points derived from expectations, and reconcile inconsistencies across prior exercises.},
